# this is wip

Currently the mod is in an usable state, but it may (and likely) does contain bugs that need to be ironed out. If you find issues, please let me know!

# known bugs

1. Go to your `Geometry Dash` folder (the one with `GeometryDash.exe` in it)
2. Open `absolutedlls` with notepad
3. Add a new line and on it type "path/to/GDShare.dll" (replace path/to with the actual path to the file)

### With ModLdr

1. Add GDShare.dll to your `mods` folder

### With GDDLLLoader

1. Add GDShare.dll to your `adaf-dlls` folder

### For other modloaders

1. Ask the developer how to add normal DLLs as mods.
